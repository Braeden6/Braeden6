## Full Stack Software Developer | AI Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

---

I'm currently working as a Full Stack Software Developer with a keen interest in the backend. My professional journey has allowed me to experiment with a myriad of tools and technologies, and also led me towards developing an interest in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI.

### **🔭 Current Work**

My work is divided into two main areas:

**Enterprise Website Development:** Here, I am involved in creating proof-of-concept implementations for incorporating Generative AI into our enterprise website. This consists in developing AI-driven chatbots and code editors to drive user engagement and efficiency.

**Contractual Projects:** Alongside my primary job, I'm currently contributing to developing research and report-writing tools for engineering consulting firms. A significant part of my role here involves ensuring the textual accuracy of these tools and backing up the information with reliable resources.

### **🛠️ Personal Projects**

I'm a staunch believer in learning through doing, and to this end, I maintain a couple of side projects:

[**Personal Website:**](https://braedensconsulting.com/) This project is a personal website featuring a resume builder and a map tool for visualizing global datasets. It also hosts my resume and has an inbuilt login system for data security. The entire data flow is managed using a custom-developed database.

[**The Programming Lab:**](https://theprogramminglab.com/) A platform designed for budding web developers to collaborate and deploy their own web applications. The Lab offers a login system, template code, auto-deployment, and various other development tools to encourage user collaboration and learning.

### **💡 Interests**

AI, especially Generative AI, intrigues me a lot, and I am constantly exploring new ways to leverage it for creating innovative solutions. Other areas of interest include Langchain, OpenAI, Python, FastAPI, GCP, Kubernetes, Firebase, and some frontend technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and Material UI.

### **🎓 Education**

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The University of British Columbia (UBC)
- Diploma in Engineering
