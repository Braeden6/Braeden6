I’m a full-stack engineer with a strong focus on backend systems, distributed architectures, and AI-driven applications. I’m currently the primary engineer at BuzzMeUp, where I build the core backend services, frontend apps, and overall system architecture for our next-generation smart buzzer/concierge platform.

### **🛠️ Personal Work**

I maintain several self-hosted and open-source projects, including:
	•	A multi-node k3s homelab with Traefik, Longhorn, ArgoCD, and automation workflows
	•	Developer tools, templates, and more
  
### **💡 Interests**

Generative AI, backend architecture, distributed systems, Kubernetes/k3s, Postgres, FastAPI, OpenAI tooling, authentication systems, Next.js, TypeScript, and DevOps workflows.

Feel free to contact me for any collaboration opportunities, work-related questions, or a discussion on all things tech!
