## Full Stack Software Developer | AI Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

---

I'm currently working as an AI Software Developer with a keen interest in the backend. My professional journey has allowed me to experiment with a myriad of tools and technologies, and also led me towards developing an interest in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI.

### **üî≠ Current Work**

My work is divided into two main areas:

**Enterprise Development**: Currently building a document management system for the airline industry, focusing on safety, document processing, and AI integrations.

**Contractual Projects:** Alongside my primary job, I'm currently contributing to developing research and report-writing tools for engineering consulting firms. A significant part of my role here involves ensuring the textual accuracy of these tools and backing up the information with reliable resources.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Personal Projects**

I'm a staunch believer in learning through doing, and to this end, I maintain a couple of side projects:

**Personal Website:**(old, new website in progress at [link](https://braeden6.com), all self hosted) This project is a personal website featuring a resume builder and a map tool for visualizing global datasets. It also hosts my resume and has an inbuilt login system for data security. The entire data flow is managed using a custom-developed database. All open source, [here](https://github.com/Braeden6/my-website).

**The Programming Lab:** A platform designed for budding web developers to collaborate and deploy their own web applications. The Lab offers a login system, template code, auto-deployment, and various other development tools to encourage user collaboration and learning. All open source, [here](https://github.com/orgs/The-Programming-Lab/repositories).

### **üí° Interests**

AI, especially Generative AI, intrigues me a lot, and I am constantly exploring new ways to leverage it for creating innovative solutions. Other areas of interest include OpenAI, Python, FastAPI, k3s (self-hosting), Authentik, Postgres, and some frontend technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn, and Tailwindcss.

### **üéì Education**

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The University of British Columbia (UBC)
- Diploma in Engineering
